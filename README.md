## Academic Course Project: Graph Differential Privacy

This project was completed as part of the ECM 3A academic course, specifically for the UE COM module. The focus of the project is on Graph Differential Privacy.

### Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the vulnerabilities of graph data compared to tabular data. The project includes:

1. **Comparison of Data Formats**: Analyzing the impact of an attack on both graph and tabular data formats.
2. **Differential Privacy Solutions**: Implementing a simple Differential Privacy (DP) solution by regularizing both models.
3. **Performance vs. Safety Tradeoff**: Evaluating the tradeoff between performance and safety when applying DP techniques.
4. **Attack Methodology**: The attack used in this project is a **Membership Inference Attack**. This type of attack attempts to determine whether a given data record was part of the training dataset, highlighting the privacy vulnerabilities in both graph and tabular data formats.

### Contents

- **Data Analysis**: Detailed comparison of the effects of attacks on graph and tabular data.
- **DP Implementation**: Code and methodology for applying regularization to enhance privacy.
- **Results**: Performance metrics and safety analysis post-DP application.

### Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of considering data format when applying Differential Privacy techniques and provides insights into the performance and safety tradeoffs involved.
